# Gallagher-Station-Museum-Exhibit
A code repository for the Duke Energy funded exhibit at the Padgett Museum of the Gallagher Station.

I tried to make this as easy as possible for everyone in the group.

Watch a few vids on Github. Here's a guy thats not boring:

Don't watch all of them if you don't want to, just watch a few until you get the gist of what all of this is.

Download Git:
https://git-scm.com/downloads

Default settings throughout the installation process.

I made some excecutable files to make all of this super simple if you want to work on this on your computer, and not on the Github website.

Download "run_once_then_delete.bat", place it at the location that you want the Gallagher files to be downloaded and based from, and run it.
You can then delete that excecutable, as well as the one downloaded in the folder. The other two .bat files you will be using for further downloads of the code, and uploads to Github.

How to use the excecutables:
When **beginnng** you work on a portion of code, run the "Pull_From_Github.bat" file. This will download the latest version of the master branch of code for you to work on. You would then work on your own computer from the files that were downloaded in any text editor or software that you prefer. Do not change the order, name, or location of the files in the folder.
If you are returning to your code after working on it, **DO NOT** run the "Pull_From_Github.bat" file, this will delete all of your progress of what you have on your computer.
If you don't want to risk anything, you can always just work on your code from the Github website here, but from *your* branch, not the master branch.

When you are done working on your code, run the "Push_To_Github.bat" file. Follow the prompts to the best of your ability. This will then upload your code to Github. If the code you uploaded is the finished product of your task, create a pull request in the pull request tab of Github. This would allow me to check your work and add it to the master branch throughout this process.

If you have any questions or issues, please let me know. It can be a bit crazy and scary at first, but once you get it, you *get* it.
