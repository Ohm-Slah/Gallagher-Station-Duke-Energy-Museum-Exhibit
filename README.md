The Duke Energy Gallagher Station is located in New Albany, IN, and was a power generating facility that was of tremendous aid in powering Southern Indiana from 1958 until decommissioning in June of 2021. Duke Energy proposed the creation of an interactive museum exhibit representing the operation of a coal-fired power plant, with focus on the control system within the display. 

This project will be located at the Padgett Museum in New Albany, IN. The showcase will educate users on energy production control using older and current technologies and incorporating donated equipment from the Gallagher Station. The interactive exhibit will primarily be used by senior museum guests during normal operating hours of the Padgett Museum for an average of XX amount of time, and will not require training or previous knowledge of power systems to interact with it. This project must safely fit into the designated area of the museum without obstructing walking paths or needing to modify the surrounding environment. This project must be capable of being moved to a school and interacted with by a younger audience.
